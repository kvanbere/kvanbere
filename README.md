### Hey, it's really great to meet you 👋

My name is Kyle. I'm currently working part time and I'm also [pioneering](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/jehovahs-will/jw-pioneer/) as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

I have two engineering degrees. My career follows my interests, but here are some of the industries that I've been involved with:

✨ Designed electric powertrains as an electrical engineer
✨ Written safety critical drive-by-wire firmware for trucks
✨ Wrote a web application that eventually replaced the offering of a SAP competitor
✨ Worked as a reverse engineer ("hacker")

At the moment I'm operating my own consulting business providing robust operational solutions for businesses - we can professionally manage your email systems, file systems, applications, servers etc. My work is very precise and detail-oriented, so if you're looking for a special person to take care of your business then [I'd love to hear from you](mailto:kyle.vanberendonck@cuedo.com.au).
