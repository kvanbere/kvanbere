### Hey, it's *really great* to meet you 👋

I'm Kyle, and I currently work part-time because I'm also [pioneering](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/jehovahs-will/jw-pioneer/) as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

My career follows my interests (I have two engineering degrees), but here are some of the industries that I've been involved with:

✨ Designed electric powertrains as an electrical engineer  
✨ Written safety critical ISO 26262 drive-by-wire firmware for trucks as a firmware engineer  
✨ Wrote a web application that eventually replaced the offering of a SAP competitor  
✨ Worked as a reverse engineer ("hacker")  
✨ Comissioned the automated gate for one of Melbourne's largest assembly venues  
✨ Gone on an epic roadtrip across Australia to volunteer data cabling for a rural Kingdom Hall

At the moment I'm operating my own consulting business providing robust operational solutions for businesses - we can professionally manage your email systems, file systems, applications, servers etc. My work is very precise and detail-oriented, so if you're looking for a special person to take care of your business then [I'd love to hear from you](mailto:kyle.vanberendonck@cuedo.com.au).
